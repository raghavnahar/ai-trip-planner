The city was founded in the 18th century by a Sikh guru called Guru Ram Rai and to honor him the Dhamawala village annually hosts a pompous fair. Dehradun also has a massive significance in terms of its history and geography. It is believed that after the battle between Ravana and Lord Rama, Lord Rama and his brother Lakshmana visited here. There is much evidence such as temples and idols which prove the significance linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. The place also marks the footprints of the mighty Mughal empire. Aurangzeb was highly impressed by this city and asked the then Maharaja of Garhwal, Fateh Shah to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. But Dehradun was soon invaded by Mahmud of Ghazni during his campaigns into India. Later followed by Timur in 1368, Chief of Rohilla, Najib ad-Dawlah in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. Dehradun embarks beautiful landscapes and scenic points as it lies in Doon Valley and is situated at a height ranging from 400 meters to above 700 meters. The Valley holds many important cities of Dehradun which are Rishikesh, Doiwala, Harrawala, Dehradun, Herbertpur, Vikasnagar, Sahaspur and Clement Town. SUGGESTED THINGS TO DO Dehradun is a stunning city and is definitely a must visit for all the people living in India especially where people rarely experience snow. Even if you take weeks off, you cannot leave the city and move to your home and thus here we come with some things that you must visit or experience while you\u2019re in Dehradun in order to make the most out of your holiday. Experiencing water sports in Rishikesh is the number one thing that you can do. This cannot be described in words; you have to experience it there. But this is a nasty sport and precautions must be taken while performing anything like this.The second is Paragliding in Mussoorie. Being a city on the top, Mussoorie is famous for its Paragliding activities and zip lining and the snow of course! Then comes visiting the local temples and the Deer Park to witness some of the wildlife there. MAIN ATTRACTIONS Dehradun is a beautiful city all packed with scenic landscapes and mesmerizing locations.

Paris Facts Paris is the most visited city in Europe, with over 44 million tourists a year. There is only one straight street in the entire city! All the others have a winding or circular pattern. Despite its name, Pont Neuf, or the New Bridge, is the oldest bridge in the city. Construction finished in 1607. Paris is home to the first restaurant \u2013 Le Procope, which opened in 1686. Many metro stations also feature prominent artworks, so you don\u2019t have to go to a museum to find culture in Paris. There are over 400 parks and gardens in Paris\u2019s city center. Luxembourg Gardens is our favorite! Stroll or take a boat tour on the river Seine during your Paris trip. Paris Geography At first glance, Paris\u2019s layout may not seem intuitive. But once you understand how the city is organized, then you can better navigate the streets and different arrondissements (pronounced: ur-aan-duhs-muhnt) during your visit. The city is dissected by the Seine River \u2013 the Right Bank is to the north and the Left Bank is to the south. The ancient heart of the city is the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, the island in the river Seine where you will find the Notre-Dame Cathedral. Paris with the Seine River at the center and major monuments shown to help you get your bearings. A Gallic settlement called Lutetia settled on the island in the 3rd century BC or earlier. In the 4th century, it was home to a Roman fortress, and the first King of the Franks built his castle here in 508. The Pont Neuf crosses the island on the downstream side of the Seine. There are 20 arrondissements. These administrative districts can be thought of as different neighborhoods. The first arrondissement starts in the center of Paris near the Louvre Museum on the Right Bank. The districts wind in a clockwise direction around the city center, covering both the left and right banks. Street signs usually give the arrondissement in Roman numerals. Locals refer to them as \u201cHe lives in the 6th.\u201d Paris with the Arrondissements starting in the center and spiraling clockwise outward. Paris Travel Guide: FAQs Before we go any further, we thought it would be nice to share a few quick facts that all travelers should know before they go to Paris. What\u2019s the currency in Paris? As with many other countries in Europe, France uses the Euro. Do I need cash in Paris? Generally speaking, most businesses in Paris will take credit cards. However, carrying cash is always a good idea, as some smaller shops or street market vendors may not accept cards. If you plan to use a card abroad, we always recommend using a card that does not have foreign transaction fees. Find out how much a trip to Paris will cost in this article! Cash and using ATMs in Paris are two of our 19 Paris Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for First Timers. Can I use my electronics in Paris? Yes, you can use your electronics while in Paris. However, you may need to purchase an adaptor or power converter. France and many other European countries use Type C plugs (they have two round prongs). This is necessary if you want to charge your phone, laptop, camera, or any other direct current (DC) electronic device while traveling. A hairdryer, for example, is an alternating-current (AC) device. These require a converter (120 volts to 240 volts). We don\u2019t recommend bringing hair dryers, straighteners, and other AC devices.

So take this issue as a guide\u2014eat and shop and stay at the places the T&C mafia recommends, and then add your own. Here's my take: Before I leave, I book Laurent or Antony at Just Ask, the best drivers and fixers in teh city. They have saved us during multiple fashion weeks, set us up with excellent guides for the Louvre, and figured out how to do Normandy in one day. I make sure there's a room for me on the seventh floor of the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, my home away from home, and that I have a morning for breakfast there (when I devour that iconic bread basket) and a night for dinner at Le Relais (where I attack Jean Imbert's delicious chicken and mashed potatoes). I always book a dinner at Chez Georges on Rue du Mail, where I have the fris\u00e9e salad and the steak frites\u2014and the baba au rhum. I make sure to have lunch or dinner at Le Voltaire and a pizza at Gigi. And on most visits, by the end of the trip, when I'm feeling a bit homesick, I have le burger and le martini at Ralph's (that courtyard in good weather!). This month I'll make a point of trying a new Greek place called Spiti Sou that everyone keeps telling me about. And I'll make sure to tell you all about it.

Jerome Gallano/Peninsula Hotels/Marcelo Barbosa/Hotel de CrillonAnyone who has been to Paris enough has a favorite hotel. And, if you ask, they will gladly\u2014and passionately\u2014tell you why they never stay anywhere else. Maybe they love it because it takes them back to the first time they came to Paris with their fabulous grandmother. Maybe they love it because no one else really knows about it (well, until now\u2014sorry!). Maybe it's because it makes them feel right at home\u2014or transports them to another world. Maybe it's simply because it has the best hotel bar that makes the best martinis, or because their room has the best views of the Eiffel Tower (no judgement!). Below, we asked a few of our most discerning friends to defend their choices. HERE ARE THE NOMINATIONS\"It's all about walking around the city and getting lost.

Kirat (or qui ne rate rien, as she was known locally: \u201cshe who misses nothing\u201d) was exhaustingly social. Her circle of friends consisted of a deposed Georgian prince, a French countess, a Portuguese heiress, and a Charlusian character of ill repute (I\u2019ll call him Umero).

Although it seems as if we all know Paris even before we see it, nothing compares to actually being there. Going to the top of the Eiffel Tower, walking along the Seine at dusk or sipping coffee at an elegant sidewalk cafe are quintessential Parisian experiences\u2014and the wonder of it is that real life takes on an aura of magical make-believe, so that it seems just like being in the movies. Whether you're in Paris for work or for fun, do as the Parisians do and enjoy yourself in this romantic city. For the art lover, the Musee d'Orsay and the Louvre offer priceless collections, while the designer shops and chic boutiques of Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, Boulevard Saint-Germain and Avenue Montaigne tempt the serious shopper. And for anyone who enjoys good food, Paris' restaurants, from inexpensive neighborhood bistros to the most refined and elegant gourmet establishments, will provide delightful meals. Geography Paris is divided into 20 arrondissements, or districts, which spiral outward clockwise from the center of the city. Knowing the arrondissements will help tremendously in navigating the city. For example, in an address with a Parisian postal code such as 75008 or 75018, the first numbers indicate Paris and the last two digits tell you the arrondissement (in this case, the 8th and 18th, respectively).Along the Right Bank (Rive Droite)\u2014that is, along the north bank of the Seine\u2014lie the grand boulevards (such as the Champs-Elysees, in the 8th), stately facades featuring Haussmanian or art-nouveau architecture, the Arc de Triomphe, the Opera Garnier (9th) and the Louvre (1st). Tucked away in the midst of all this grandeur are the trendy, winding streets of the Marais District (4th), where you can see several of Paris' oldest surviving buildings. Montmartre (18th), the northernmost area of the Right Bank, resembles a little village, with steep, cobblestoned streets, oft-photographed staircases and tiny, ivy-covered houses. The area around the Bastille (11th)\u2014where the infamous prison once stood\u2014has become one of the trendiest pockets of Paris, with numerous cafes and clubs, as well as barge restaurants on the refurbished Bassin de la Villette (19th). Although the Left Bank (Rive Gauche) has the reputation for being slightly funkier than the Right, it is also very chic and home to some of the most expensive real estate in Paris. The Latin Quarter (5th) is always buzzing with activity, especially with students of Sorbonne University. The cafes of Saint-Germain-des-Pres (6th) are experiencing renewed interest among followers of such philosophers as Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, who once gathered there to debate existentialism. Montparnasse (14th), formerly the home of Picasso, Alberto Giacometti and other artists, is a bustling neighborhood adjacent to Saint-Germain-des-Pres. It's crowded with cinemas and famous brasseries.La Defense refers to the cluster of skyscrapers on the northwestern edge of Paris that makes up the modern business district. The landmark of this quarter is La Grande Arche\u2014a massive, futuristic arch of glass, granite and marble that serves as a modern echo of Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe.Note: In this guide, the ordinal number in parentheses following each street address indicates the arrondissement in which an address is located. For example, (7th) refers to the 7th arrondissement. The nearest metro stop is given after the arrondissement. Also, in an address, don't be confused by the word bis after a street number. If you see 10-bis, for instance, it indicates the door or building next to No. 10. History Paris started out as a little village inhabited by a tribe of people known as the Parisii. The original settlement was located on an island in the Seine River that later became the Roman island-city of Lutetia; today it is Ile de la Cite, the site of Notre-Dame Cathedral. Over the centuries, Paris expanded onto the right and left (north and south) banks of the river, and the city's defensive walls were pushed outward in ever-expanding concentric \"circles\" to accommodate the growing population; there are places in Paris where you can", "timestamp": 1755893693.573092}, "https://www.introducingparis.com/": {"content": "Paris - Tourism and travel guide - Introducing Paris Paris, the capital of France, is one of the most important and influential cities in the world.
